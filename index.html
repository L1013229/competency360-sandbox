                            <h2>Why does my organisation need Competency360?</h2>
                            <p>Your organisation should consider using Parallaxx's Competency 360 service in response to the discontinuation of many CoPTTM warrants by NZTA because:</p>

                            <h3>Shift in Responsibility</h3>
                            <p>With the NZTA moving away from centralised competency tracking, the burden of monitoring staff qualifications, competency, and compliance now falls heavily on employers. <strong>Competency 360 provides an easy and effective solution for tracking these competencies across your workforce, ensuring you remain compliant without the need for complex internal systems.</strong></p>

                            <h3>Customisation and Efficiency</h3>
                            <p>Parallaxx tailors its services to meet the specific needs of your organisation, providing a customised competency matrix and tracking system that aligns directly with your roles and requirements. This makes it easier for employers to track and maintain competency records, reducing the administrative burden.</p>

                            <h3>Future-Proofing</h3>
                            <p>As the industry transitions to the new TTM Credentials Framework, Parallaxxâ€™s Competency 360 service helps ensure your organisation stays ahead of the changes by providing up-to-date competency assessments and reporting, all while leveraging on-job evidence and training tailored to your operations. Additionally, by engaging with Competency360 you will have access to a knowledge hub that provides short micro-courses, covering knowledge areas that contribute to the competency snapshots.</p>

                            <p>By using Competency 360, your organisation will not only comply with the new requirements but also benefit from a streamlined and future-proofed competency management system.</p>
